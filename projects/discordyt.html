                            <p>Discord YT Chrome Extension is an extention that displays what youtube video/music you are listening to on your discord profile</p>
                            <p>It uses your user token or bot token to make api calls from your account and uses the wrapper discord.js for api calls</p>
                            <p>You can also choose if you want to display only music or both music and videos</p>

                        <p>Discord TOS says they do not allow self-bots which this program is. HOWEVER, if you set the status to "Playing" instead of "Listening" or "Watching", there is no way to tell if you are using a self. There is an option in the extension to do that. </p>
                        <p>As long as you aren't in any public servers, it should be completely ok.</p>
